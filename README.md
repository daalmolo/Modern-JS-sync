# Modern JS from the beginning

This is a 36+ hour in-depth course that will take you from the absolute beginning of JavaScript, learning about data types, functions and loops to learning DOM manipulation, asynchronous JS with promises, async/await and much more. You will even learn how to write unit tests for algorithms. We go into how JavaScript works under the hood including execution context, the call stack, event loop, etc. We learn about Webpack tooling and how to create a modern development environment. At the end, we build a Node.js/Express API with a custom Webpack frontend.

### Learning objectives
 
- **Basics & Fundamentals:** Data types, let & const variables, functions, conditionals, loops, object literals, etc

- **Data Structures** - Arrays, objects, maps, sets as well as custom data structures like stacks and queues

- **DOM Manipulation -** Selectors, traversing the DOM, show/hide, creating & removing elements, event listeners

- **OOP -** Constructor functions, prototypes, inheritance, classes, protected properties, getters/setters

- **Async JS -** Ajax & XHR, Fetch API, callbacks, promises, async / await

- **Error Handling -** Try...Catch, HTTP errors

- **Web & Browser APIs -** Canvas, geolocation, audio/video, web animations API

- **Modules & Tooling** - CommonJS & ES Modules, Webpack,  plugins, loaders, modern dev environment &  workflow

- **Unit Testing Algorithms** - Learn the Jest testing library and algorithms like palindromes and anagrams

- **Node.js & Express** - Learn about Node modules, NPM packages and build a REST API with Express & MongoDB

- **Full Stack Development** - We build an API with Express and a frontend with Webpack. No frontend frameworks!
